# Creational Design Patterns Examples

The goal is to serve as a reference and learning resource for students, developers, and anyone interested in design patterns, providing clear and well-documented implementations in different programming languages.

## Included Patterns

- **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method:** Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- **Abstract Factory:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
- **Prototype:** Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

## Repository Structure

Each pattern has its own directory containing:
- A brief theoretical explanation
- Example source code, preferably in multiple languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java)
- Usage examples

## How to Use

Explore each directory to understand how each pattern works. The examples are self-explanatory and can be run directly for experimentation.

## Contributing

Suggestions for improvements, examples in other languages, or additional explanations are always welcome!
